Project overview:
Project Planning:
1.)Target Organisation:
For my target organisation, I will be choosing a small business “Fitted by Asia”, an apparel business that mainly sells caps and beanies.
My goal is to develop a functional and visually appealing website that will meet the needs of the business, I will ensure that the website I’m creating is easy to navigate, informative and engaging.

2.)Research and planning:
In order to develop the website, I will have to conduct research about the business so that I can include everything essential to the organisation. I will have to use pictures and/or videos of products and services that the business offers in order to make the website appealing and useful. Including information about the business in the website could also prove very useful and informative to potential customers that are looking to purchase items from the website, it could also help with informing customers about products and services and inform them about the business’ goal and objectives for it’s target audience and market. Research will also include getting the contact details of the business such as a contact number and contact email, by doing this it will allow me to add these resources into the website, proving useful to potential customers that are looking to contact the business, this could be for enquiries about products and services, leaving reviews and placing orders from the business, this could also prove beneficial for the business by providing efficient communication between customers and the business itself. Adding assets like this to the website are crucial to making the website effective and functional, as well as providing the business with benefits.

Goals and objectives:
My main goal for the business’ website is to:
-build a strong online presence that reflects fitted by asia’s brand identity as well as its style
-provide customers with an easy to navigate platform for browsing and purchasing products
-offer a personalised experience to engage loyal customers and potentially attract new ones
-serve as a marketing tool for the business with integrated social media features
By doing this, I can create a functional, visually appealing and efficient website that increases publicity for the business and sales

The website will include:
-a homepage that showcases the brand and its products and services
-a shop section that features products produced by the business
-an about us page that provides the story and background of the brand as well as its goals
-a contact page that provides contact details for the business such as a contact number as well as a contact email
